# K2hash

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/k2hash`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'k2hash'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install k2hash

## Usage

```ruby
#! /usr/bin/env ruby

require "k2hash"

file = "/tmp/example.k2h"

K2hash.open(file, "w") do |db|
  db.set_str_value("mykey", "myval")
end

K2hash.open(file, "r") do |db|
  value = db.get_str_direct_value("mykey")
  p value
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
